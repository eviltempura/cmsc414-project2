read.c is not secure because even though the author made the buffer
relatively large (512 bytes) the code is still vulnerable to buffer
overflow due to the fact that string size is not specified while
reading into the buffer.

substring.c is also not secure. The author implemented a buffer to dump
excessive characters in the input. However, when reading into this dump
buffer, string size is not specified which indicates a buffer overflow
vulnerability.
